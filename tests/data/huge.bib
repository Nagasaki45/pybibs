Group conversation is a form of conversation in which three or more participants talk to each other about a topic on an equal footing. Conventional conversation systems have been designed under the assumption that each system merely talked with only one person. Group conversation is different from these conventional systems in the following points. It is necessary for the system to understand the conversational situation such as who is speaking, to whom he is speaking, and also to whom the other participants pay attention. It is also necessary for the system itself to try to affect the situation appropriately. In this study, we realized the function of recognizing the conversational situation, by combining image processing and acoustic processing, and the function of working on the conversational situation utilizing facial and body actions of the robot. Thus, a robot that can join in the group conversation was realized.",

This allows users wearing virtual or augmented reality displays to see, hear and interact with remote participants in 3D, almost as if they were present in the same physical space. From an audio-visual perspec-tive, communicating and interacting with remote users edges closer to face-to-face communication.

This creates an illusion of the remote person's physical presence in the local space, as well as a shared understanding of verbal and non-verbal cues (e.g., gaze, pointing.) In addition to the technical details of two prototype implementations, we contribute strategies for projecting remote participants onto physically plausible locations, such that they form a natural and consistent conversational formation with the local participant. We also present observations and feedback from an evaluation with 7 pairs of participants on the usability of our solution for solving a collaborative, physical task. {\textcopyright} 2016 ACM.",

During this task, the nonverbal behavior of 104 participants in 52 pairs was tracked and recorded using the Kinect computer vision algorithm. We created a measure of synchrony by correlating movements between the two dyad members, and showed that synchrony occurred-that is, correlations decreased when we increased delay between the recorded movements of pair members. We also demonstrated a link between nonverbal synchrony and creativity, as operationalized by the number of new, valid ideas produced. Linear correlations demonstrated a significant relationship between synchrony and creativity. Finally, models using synchrony scores as input predicted whether dyads were high or low in creativity with a success rate as high as 86.7\% in the more exclusive subsets. We discuss implications for methodological approaches to measuring nonverbal behavior and synchrony, and suggest practical applications which can leverage the current findings.",

'According to Gordon Allport (1968) the original meaning of the term empathy was "objective motor mimicry"; it is only in the later half of the 20th century that it came to be used as a global term encompassing vicarious emotion, role taking, and the ability to understand others'. First observation of body posture as social tool by Scheflen in 1964. From there 3 paths of research: rhythmic synchrony, facial mimicry, and behaviour matching. First study that explicitly attempts to show causality from mimicry to rapport. Authors try to hide their hypothesis all the time. Sometime it make sense, but sometimes I'm not sure I see the reason for doing it. For example, embedding the 2 questions of interest in experiment 2 in 8 irrelevant questions. Repeated mistakes in concluding that there is no difference between things by showing no significant difference (a la Saffran et. al 1999). In experiment 3. Shouldn't it be correlation between the questionnaire answers and the mimicry behaviour, instead of ANOVA? 'Perception causes similar behaviour' - if I can't find anything better, this claim kind of supports the idea of head nods mimicry. No consideration of timing of mimicry at all. Nothing about head nods mimicry.}

So I won't jump to say that social encounters are organized in place and cannot be easily explained using space. In addition, the environment described in the paper is only inspired by spatial organization. So it's not the best candidate to explore whether or not another concept is needed to describe social organization. Also, there are other concepts that describe "being-with" (maybe rapport).

    ISSN = "1664-1078",
    ABSTRACT = "There is a growing consensus that a fuller understanding of social cognition depends on more systematic studies of real-time social interaction. Such studies require methods that can deal with the complex dynamics taking place at multiple interdependent temporal and spatial scales, spanning sub-personal, personal, and dyadic levels of analysis. We demonstrate the value of adopting an extended multi-scale approach by re-analyzing movement time series generated in a study of embodied dyadic interaction in a minimal virtual reality environment (a perceptual crossing experiment). Reduced movement variability revealed an interdependence between social awareness and social coordination that cannot be accounted for by either subjective or objective factors alone: it picks out interactions in which subjective and objective conditions are convergent (i.e. elevated coordination is perceived as clearly social, and impaired coordination is perceived as socially ambiguous). This finding is consistent with the claim that interpersonal interaction can be partially constitutive of direct social perception. Clustering statistics (Allan Factor) of salient events revealed fractal scaling. Complexity matching defined as the similarity between these scaling laws was significantly more pronounced in pairs of participants as compared to surrogate dyads. This further highlights the multi-scale and distributed character of social interaction and extends previous complexity matching results from dyadic conversation to nonverbal social interaction dynamics. Trials with successful joint interaction were also associated with an increase in local coordination. Consequently, a local coordination pattern emerges on the background of complex dyadic interactions in the PCE task and makes joint successful performance possible.",

Theories change over the 80s-90s, from very negative (hostility) to 'better'. Nice although implicit point about 'real life' interaction - misleading description. Sustaining relationships: two major studies report decrease in social activity and increase of depression. Every other study reported the opposite. The authors support the claim that internet use improve the social life. Relationship formation - easier self-disclosure, and idealising the other partner, helps. Very positive evidence for no difference between friendships that originate from internet use to other forms of communication. For minorities - the internet is an anonymous place where one doesn't have to tell race / gender / etc. On the other hand hatred groups flourish there, so there is no clear benefit for these groups. In General, somewhat shallow. Not very good. Largely irrelevant for today - it deals with written world wide web (not internet), like forums and email. I believe that both social media and smart phones changed the game completely."

This special issue argues for the opposite view: Miscommunication is a highly structured and ubiquitous feature of human interaction that systematically underpins people's ability to create and maintain shared languages. Contributions from conversation analysis, computational linguistics, experimental psychology, and formal semantics provide evidence for these claims. They highlight the multi‐modal, multi‐person character of miscommunication. They demonstrate the incremental, contingent, and locally adaptive nature of the processes people use to detect and deal with miscommunication. They show how these processes can drive language change. In doing so, these contributions introduce an alternative perspective on what successful communication is, new methods for studying it, and application areas where these ideas have a particular impact. We conclude that miscommunication is not noise but essential to the productive flexibility of human communication, especially our ability to respond constructively to new people and new situations.",
